# Centennial College - Natural Language Processing Project

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the COMP262 NLP project at Centennial College.  
The project explores natural language processing techniques to build and evaluate models for text analysis.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks with experiments and model training  
- `src/` → Source code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation  
- `data/` → Dataset files (if applicable)  
- `docs/` → Documentation and project specification  
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.11+  
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Usage
Run the main script:
python src/main.py
Or open the Jupyter notebooks:

## 📑 Project Specification
The full exercise specification is available in [The full exercise specification is available in [docs/specification.md](docs/specification.md).].
This document outlines the requirements, objectives, and evaluation criteria for the project.
Summary of requirements:
- Implement NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Train and evaluate at least one ML/DL model
- Provide performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.)
- Document findings and conclusions
